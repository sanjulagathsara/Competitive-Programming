set is a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. For example, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are distinct objects when considered separately, but when they are considered collectively, they form a single set of size three, written {1,2,3}.

set can also be defined by a property that its members must satisfy

set can also be defined by a property that its members must satisfy and a condition
